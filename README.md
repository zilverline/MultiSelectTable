# MultiSelectTable

Repo for the __"Rearranging and hiding items in a UITableView"__ blog at https://tech.zilverline.com/2017/03/17/creating-multiselect-uitableview

Creating a TableView just like Appleâ€™s own Mail App where you rearrange and hide Mail Folders is pretty straigthforward, once you know how to do it.

After searching blogs, iOS documentation and Stack Overflow I finally found the (a?) proper way. In this blog I share my findings. I will build a table that can be rearranged and where you can select rows (to hide them).
